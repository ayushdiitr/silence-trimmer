# Railway Worker Setup - Quick Guide

## TL;DR

You need **2 separate services** on Railway from the same repo:
1. **Web Service** - Runs `npm run start` (Next.js)
2. **Worker Service** - Runs `npm run start:worker` (FFmpeg processing)

## Why Two Services?

The worker is **NOT** part of your Next.js app. It's a separate background process that:

- ‚úÖ Runs independently from your web server
- ‚úÖ Can scale separately (more workers = faster video processing)
- ‚úÖ Can restart without affecting your website
- ‚úÖ Processes videos using FFmpeg (CPU-intensive)
- ‚úÖ Listens to Redis queue for jobs

**Architecture:**
```
User uploads video ‚Üí Web app adds job to Redis queue
                  ‚Üì
            Worker picks up job from queue
                  ‚Üì
            Worker processes video with FFmpeg
                  ‚Üì
            Worker saves result to R2
                  ‚Üì
            Worker updates database & sends email
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Deploy Web Service (If Not Already Done)

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your repo
4. Railway creates a **Web Service** automatically
5. Add environment variables (see main RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)
6. Deploy

### 2. Add PostgreSQL & Redis

1. Click "+ New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
2. Click "+ New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "Redis"
3. Railway automatically connects them to all services

### 3. Deploy Worker Service

This is the important part! üöÄ

#### A. Create the Service

1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Choose the **SAME repository** as your web service
4. Railway creates a second service (initially it might try to run as a web app)

#### B. Configure the Service

Click on the new service, then go to **Settings**:

1. **Service Name**
   - Change to: `worker` (or `video-worker`)
   
2. **Root Directory**
   - Leave as: `/` (root of repo)
   
3. **Build Command**
   - Set to: `npm install`
   
4. **Start Command** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
   - Set to: `npm run start:worker`
   - This is what makes it run as a worker instead of a web server!
   
5. **Custom Build Command** (Optional)
   - If you have a `railway.worker.json` in your repo:
     - In Settings ‚Üí "Service" ‚Üí "Config File Path"
     - Set to: `railway.worker.json`

#### C. Copy Environment Variables

The worker needs **ALL the same environment variables** as your web service.

**Quick Method:**
1. Go to your **Web service** ‚Üí **Variables** tab
2. Click on the "RAW Editor" button
3. Copy everything
4. Go to your **Worker service** ‚Üí **Variables** tab
5. Click "RAW Editor"
6. Paste everything

**Critical Variables:**
- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL` (should be auto-linked from PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ `REDIS_URL` (should be auto-linked from Redis)
- ‚úÖ `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_PUBLIC_URL`
- ‚úÖ `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`
- ‚úÖ `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- ‚úÖ All other environment variables from web service

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Both services MUST use the same `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL`. Railway links these automatically.

#### D. Deploy

1. The worker service will automatically deploy
2. Go to the **Deployments** tab
3. Check the **Logs**

**Success looks like:**
```
Video processing worker started
Connected to Redis: redis://...
Temp directory: /tmp/video-processor
```

**Failure looks like:**
```
‚ùå Invalid environment variables
```
‚Üí Fix: Add missing environment variables

### 4. Verify It Works

1. **Upload a test video** from your web app dashboard
2. **Check the worker logs** in Railway:
   ```
   Processing video job <job-id>
   Downloading video from R2...
   Running FFmpeg...
   Uploading processed video...
   Job completed successfully
   ```
3. **Check your email** for completion notification
4. **Check the database**: Job status should be "completed"

## Troubleshooting

### Worker starts but jobs aren't processing

**Problem**: Worker logs show "started" but no "Processing video job" messages

**Solutions:**
1. Check `REDIS_URL` is the same in both services
2. Verify web service is adding jobs to queue (check web logs)
3. Test Redis connection:
   ```bash
   # In Railway CLI
   railway run redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL ping
   ```

### Worker crashes immediately

**Problem**: Worker starts then exits with error code 1

**Solutions:**
1. Check worker logs for the error
2. Common issues:
   - Missing `DATABASE_URL` ‚Üí Check PostgreSQL is linked
   - Missing `REDIS_URL` ‚Üí Check Redis is linked
   - Invalid environment variables ‚Üí Check all vars are set
   - FFmpeg not found ‚Üí Should be automatic, but verify logs

### Videos stuck in "queued" status

**Problem**: Jobs are created but never start processing

**Solutions:**
1. **Check worker is running**: Look at worker deployments, should be "Active"
2. **Check worker logs**: Should see "Video processing worker started"
3. **Verify Redis connection**: Both services must use the same Redis instance
4. **Check credits**: User needs credits to process videos
5. **Restart worker**: Sometimes helps after config changes

### FFmpeg not found

**Problem**: Worker logs show "ffmpeg: command not found"

**Solution**: Add `nixpacks.toml` to your repo:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ['nodejs-20_x', 'ffmpeg-full']

[phases.install]
cmds = ['npm ci']
```

Then redeploy the worker service.

### Out of memory errors

**Problem**: Worker crashes with "JavaScript heap out of memory"

**Solutions:**
1. Upgrade Railway plan (more memory)
2. Reduce worker concurrency in `src/worker/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const worker = new Worker('video-processing', processVideoJob, {
     connection,
     concurrency: 1, // Reduce from 2 to 1
   });
   ```
3. Process smaller videos
4. Add memory limit (Railway settings)

## Monitoring

### View Worker Logs

1. Go to Railway project
2. Click on **Worker service**
3. Click **Deployments** ‚Üí Latest deployment
4. View **Logs** tab

You should see:
- `Video processing worker started` - Worker is running
- `Processing video job <id>` - Job started
- `Job <id> completed` - Job finished
- `Job <id> failed: <error>` - Job failed (check error)

### Check Queue Status

Use Railway CLI:
```bash
# Install CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login and link
railway login
railway link

# Connect to Redis
railway run redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL

# Check queue
> LLEN bull:video-processing:wait
> KEYS bull:video-processing:*
```

### Check Database

```sql
-- Count jobs by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM assignment_video_job 
GROUP BY status;

-- Recent failed jobs
SELECT id, "originalFilename", error, "createdAt"
FROM assignment_video_job 
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Scaling

### Add More Workers

Process videos faster by running multiple workers:

1. Go to Worker service ‚Üí Settings
2. Increase **Replicas** (Pro plan feature)
3. Or manually create more worker services from the same repo

Multiple workers:
- ‚úÖ Process jobs in parallel
- ‚úÖ Don't interfere with each other
- ‚úÖ Pull from the same Redis queue
- ‚úÖ Update the same database

### Increase Concurrency

Edit `src/worker/index.ts`:
```typescript
const worker = new Worker('video-processing', processVideoJob, {
  connection,
  concurrency: 4, // Process 4 jobs simultaneously per worker
});
```

**Guidelines:**
- 1-2 jobs per CPU core
- More concurrency = more memory usage
- Start with 1-2, increase if needed

## Cost Optimization

### Railway Pricing

Each service costs based on usage:
- **Web Service**: ~$5-15/month (low CPU, some requests)
- **Worker Service**: ~$10-30/month (high CPU when processing)
- **PostgreSQL**: ~$5-10/month
- **Redis**: ~$5-10/month

**Total**: ~$25-65/month for moderate usage

### Reduce Costs

1. **Scale down when not needed**: 
   - Reduce worker replicas during off-hours
   - Use Railway's auto-sleep for hobby plan

2. **Optimize FFmpeg**:
   - Lower output quality for faster processing
   - Skip unnecessary passes

3. **Use spot instances** (if available on Railway)

## Quick Reference

### Commands

```bash
# Local development
npm run dev          # Start web app
npm run dev:worker   # Start worker

# Production (Railway)
npm run start        # Web service
npm run start:worker # Worker service

# Database
npm run db:push      # Push schema changes
npm run db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio
```

### Service Configuration

**Web Service:**
- Start command: `npm run start`
- Port: Auto-detected by Railway
- Needs: PostgreSQL, Redis, env vars

**Worker Service:**
- Start command: `npm run start:worker`
- Port: Not needed (no HTTP server)
- Needs: PostgreSQL, Redis, FFmpeg, env vars

### Environment Variables

Both services need:
```env
DATABASE_URL          # Auto from Railway PostgreSQL
REDIS_URL            # Auto from Railway Redis
R2_ACCOUNT_ID
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
R2_BUCKET_NAME
R2_PUBLIC_URL
RESEND_API_KEY
EMAIL_FROM
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET      # Web only, but doesn't hurt worker
NEXTAUTH_URL         # Web only, but doesn't hurt worker
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID     # Web only, but doesn't hurt worker
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET # Web only, but doesn't hurt worker
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY    # Web only, but doesn't hurt worker
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET # Web only, but doesn't hurt worker
STRIPE_PRICE_ID      # Web only, but doesn't hurt worker
```

**Tip**: Just copy ALL variables to both services. Extra variables won't hurt.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Two services from one repo**: Web + Worker
‚úÖ **Same environment variables**: Copy all vars to both
‚úÖ **Different start commands**: `start` vs `start:worker`
‚úÖ **Shared database & Redis**: Both connect to same instances
‚úÖ **Independent scaling**: Scale web and worker separately
‚úÖ **Monitor via logs**: Railway dashboard shows all activity

Your worker is now running on Railway! üéâ

## Need Help?

- Check worker logs for errors
- Verify environment variables match
- Ensure Redis URL is the same in both services
